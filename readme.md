## About Me

Hi! I'm **Jessie**, an **IT Specialist by day**, and a **tinkerer by night**.  
I love building small, useful tools in Python — especially anything that involves automation, GUIs, or downloading cat videos.

All of this is **100% for fun**. No clients. No KPIs. Just me, VS Code, and a dream.
